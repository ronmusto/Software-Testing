# Software-Testing
The main way that I can ensure my program is functional and secure is by thorough testing. In my case I used JUnit 5 tests to make sure that my program met all the functionality required of me. The way that I interpret user needs is by envisioning how the end user will eventually use my program and the requirements outlined by the customer. I also test the code out myself by actually using it for its intended purpose and make sure that it has a pleasant and functional experience. The way that I approach software design is to first create a thorough plan based on the requirements for the program. I then start by coding the most central aspect of the program and I test it incrementally as I build it. I usually don't write more than 10-15 lines without making sure that I am still error free and functioning as intended.
